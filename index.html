  <p class="text-transparent text-left mx-auto text-xl ">
    Aylus, also known as <i>Alliance of Youth Leaders in the United States,</i> is an organization that organizes and and attends different volunteer opportunities, aiming to spread goodwill to others. I really love volunteering at Aylus (most people say that for college apps, but I really do). Whenever I volunteer, I feel like its an impact to the world, whether it's helping low-income families by volunteering at the local food bank, or protecting wildlife by attending and organizing beach cleanups. Lastly, I teach kids how to do math (mainly beast academy) and english online, and also on-site (in person). <br><br> Because of my love for volunteering and my commitment, I've been awarded a Silver Presidential Volunteer Service Award for my efforts in 2023.
