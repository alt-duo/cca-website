AYLUS, also known as the Alliance of Youth Leaders in the United States, is an organization that coordinates and participates in various volunteer opportunities with the goal of spreading goodwill to others. I genuinely enjoy volunteering at Aylus, not just for college applications, but because I truly believe in its impact. Whether I'm helping low-income families at the local food bank or organizing beach cleanups to protect wildlife, every volunteer opportunity feels like a meaningful contribution to the world. Additionally, I teach kids math, primarily using Beast Academy, and English both online and in person. Currently I am part of the leadership for AYLUS San Diego

Due to my dedication to volunteering, I was honored with a Silver Presidential Volunteer Service Award for my efforts in 2023.</p>
