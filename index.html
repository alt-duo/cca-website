<p class="mt-4  gap-auto max-w-md text-center text-xl sm:text-left">
AYLUS, also known as the <u>Alliance of Youth Leaders in the United States</u>, is an organization that coordinates and participates in various volunteer opportunities with the goal of spreading goodwill to others. I genuinely enjoy volunteering at Aylus, not just for college applications, but because I truly believe in its impact. Whether I'm helping low-income families at the local food bank or organizing beach cleanups to protect wildlife, every volunteer opportunity feels like a meaningful contribution to the world. Additionally, I teach kids math, primarily using Beast Academy, and English both online and in person. Currently I am part of the leadership for AYLUS San Diego

Due to my dedication to volunteering, I was honored with a Silver Presidential Volunteer Service Award for my efforts in 2023.</p>
